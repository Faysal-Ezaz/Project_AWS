# Project_AWS
This is a repository where I shall store all of the <b>AWS projects</b> that I have done. More over, this will serve as a <i>progress report</i> for my AWS journey where I start off with the most basic of the AWS <b>Hands-on tutorials</b>, then try learn from then.  
Then, I shall start of with some basic projects and increase the level of the projects gradually.  

<b>I aspire to be a AWS Certified Solutions Architect Engineer</b>, hence this Directory shall act as my project report.
