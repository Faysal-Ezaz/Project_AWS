Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹ this is a guide on how to <b>Create a basic EC2 instance</b> and use <b>EC2 User Data Script</b>.  

Now, before using the <i>EC2 User Data</i> let's dive deep into what is <b>EC2 User Data</b> and what is the need of using an EC2 User Data Script:  
a) By using the <b>EC2 User Data Script</b>, we can <i>Bootstrap</i> our EC2 instances.  
b) Bootstrapping means <b>"Launching Commands"<b> when a machine starts.  
This <i>script</i> is run <b>only once</b>, when the machine first starts!  
EC2 User Data is used to automate tasks like:  
i) Installing Updates.  
ii) Installing Software.  
iii) Downloading common files from the Internet, and so on.  
A point to be noted is that the EC2 User Data Script runs with the <b>'Root User'</b>.  
To know more about the EC2 User Data and BootStraps refer to this website : (https://blog.devops.dev/aws-ec2-elastic-compute-cloud-8f964f844461).
