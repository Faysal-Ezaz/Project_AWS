Short Explainations on <u><b>AWS ELB</b></u> :  
    <ul>   
      <li>Elastic Load Balancer or AWS ELB is a "fully managed" <b>Load Balancing</b> service provided by AWS.</li>  
      <li>It helps distribute incoming application traffic across <b>multiple EC2 instances</b> in a <i>Target Group</i> to ensure optimal utilization and availability of resources.</li>  
      <li>ELB plays a crucial role in <i>improving</i> <b>application performance</b>, <b>fault tolerance</b>, and <b>facilitating seamless scaling</b>.</li>  
    </ul>  

Short Explaination on <b>AWS ASG</b> : 
  <ul>
    <li>AWS ASG or Auto Scaling Group is a service provided by AWS that enables the <b>automatic scaling</b> of compute resources based on <i>application demand</i></li>  
    <li>With ASG, you can <b>ensure</b> that your application always has the right number of <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances</i> available to handle incoming traffic.</li>  
    <li>Elasticity allows us to <b>scale our infrastructure up</b> during <i>high-traffic periods</i> and scale it down during periods of reduced demand, optimizing costs and performance.</li>
  </ul>  

  <h3>Steps to build a highly available web application with AWS Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)</h3>  
  <ol>
    <li>Create two <b>EC2 isntances.</b> </li>  
    <li>Create an <b>Application Load Balancer</b> (ALB) </li>  
    <li>Create an <i>AWS Auto Scaling Group</i> (ASG) and <b>Configure Scaling Policies.</b></li>  
    <li>Create an <i>Auto Scaling</i> <b>Launch Template</b></li>  
    <li>Test and Monitor the Infrastructure.</li>
  </ol>

<h3>Working with <b>Application Load Balancers</b> :</h3>  
Step_1) Open EC2 instance and then go to Elastic Load Balancer Section. Then click on "Load Balancers".

Step_2) Click on "Create Load Balancer" and follow the steps:  
        a) Under 'Load Balancer Types', select "Application Load Balancer".   
        b) Then Click on 'Create'.

        c) Scheme is "Internet Facing" and Ip Address is "IPv4".

        d) For "Network Mapping"  we select all the 'Availability Zones'.

        e) We Create a New "Security Group".  
        ![Screenshot (1521)](https://github.com/Faysal-Ezaz/Project_AWS/assets/95119493/1fcfb573-0172-4472-b0c7-ec4654331e84)  
            i) Type the name of the Load Balancer "demo-sg-load-balancer".  
            ![Screenshot (1522)](https://github.com/Faysal-Ezaz/Project_AWS/assets/95119493/97a97a33-7322-4aff-8cde-a012034a86ae)
            ii) Inbound Rule, Anywhere.   
            iii) OutBound Rule, Anywhere.  
            ![Screenshot (1523)](https://github.com/Faysal-Ezaz/Project_AWS/assets/95119493/9364d7e6-8c91-449a-804f-8161ff941413)  
            iv) Create Security Group.   
            ![Screenshot (1524)](https://github.com/Faysal-Ezaz/Project_AWS/assets/95119493/5b2cf109-b8b8-46d5-9b92-334740e330ea)  
        f) Then we remove the default Security Group and allocate "demo-sg-load-balancer" as the security group.

        g) Creating a Target Group: Clcik on "Create Target Group" (Target Group: a list of EC2 instances that will be used to distribute the load).  
            ![Screenshot (1526)](https://github.com/Faysal-Ezaz/Project_AWS/assets/95119493/8bf50b9d-e76a-4f5b-8b15-3780ff7f366c)  
            i) Basic Configuration: "Instances".

            ii) Target Group Name: demo-tg-alb.  
            iii) No need to change anything else!
