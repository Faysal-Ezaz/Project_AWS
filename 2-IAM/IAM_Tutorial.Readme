This is an easy IAM tutorial where we will be creating 2 users namely "User1" and "User2", but there is a catch, using the root user, we create 'User1' then using 'User1' we create "User2" and assign it to a Group.
Firstly, using the Root User, we create "User1". 
After this, we will assign the required policies and Roles to 'User1' that will give admin access to "User1". 
Then, we log into User1, and then create "User2". (If we are able to do this step, it shall give us the confirmation that 'User1' has been given the admin access) 
We also assign admin access to User2 and create a group for User1 and assign User1 to that group  



Step 1) Firstly we log into the AWS root user console.
