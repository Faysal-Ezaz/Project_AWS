## Main Objective of the Mini-Project: 
A Project where we will be create <b>ELB</b> (Elastic Load Balancer) and <b>ASG</b> (Auto Scaling Group) and see how both of them are used together to provide <b>High Availability</b>.  

## Short Explainations on <u><b>AWS ELB</b></u> :  
<ul>   
      <li>Elastic Load Balancer or AWS ELB is a "fully managed" <b>Load Balancing</b> service provided by AWS.</li>  
      <li>It helps distribute incoming application traffic across <b>multiple EC2 instances</b> in a <i>Target Group</i> to ensure optimal utilization and availability of resources.</li>  
      <li>ELB plays a crucial role in <i>improving</i> <b>application performance</b>, <b>fault tolerance</b>, and <b>facilitating seamless scaling</b>.</li>  
    </ul>  

## Short Explaination on <b>AWS ASG</b> : 
<ul>
    <li>AWS ASG or Auto Scaling Group is a service provided by AWS that enables the <b>automatic scaling</b> of compute resources based on <i>application demand</i></li>  
    <li>With ASG, you can <b>ensure</b> that your application always has the right number of <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances</i> available to handle incoming traffic.</li>  
    <li>Elasticity allows us to <b>scale our infrastructure up</b> during <i>high-traffic periods</i> and scale it down during periods of reduced demand, optimizing costs and performance.</li>
  </ul>  

  ## Steps to build a <b>highly available</b> web application with AWS Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)  
  <ol>
    <li>Create two <b>EC2 instances.</b> </li>  
    <li>Create an <b>Application Load Balancer</b> (ALB) </li>  
    <li>Create an <i>AWS Auto Scaling Group</i> (ASG) and <b>Configure Scaling Policies.</b></li>  
    <li>Create an <i>Auto Scaling</i> <b>Launch Template</b></li>  
    <li>Test and Monitor the Infrastructure.</li>
  </ol>  

## Very First Step that needs to be performed:     
We have to Create <b>2 EC2 instances</b>  


## <i>Steps to create the EC2 instances:</i>    
Step_1) Go to <i>AWS Management Console</i> and <b>search</b> EC2.    

Step_2) Click on Instances and do the following:  
    <ul>  
        <li>Click on <b>Launch Instance</b>, a new screen opens up</li>  
        <li>Under <i>Name and Tags</i>, Enter the name of the Instance</li>  
        <li>Under <i>AMI</i>, choose <b>Choose Amazon Linux 2 AMI</b></li>  
        <li>Under <i>Instance Type</i>, choose <b>t2.micro</b> (free tier service).</li>  
        <li>Under <i>Key Pair</i>, select None</li>  
        <li>For <i>Storage (Volumes)</i>, nothing needs to be changed. </li>  
        <li>Now, Under <i>Advanced Details</i>, we have to scroll down to the very bottom and then paste the following code. </li>  
  
        #!/bin/bash  
        # Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)  
        # install httpd (Linux 2 version)  
        yum update -y  
        yum install -y httpd  
        systemctl start httpd  
        systemctl enable httpd  
        echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html  
<li>Finally before we click on <i>Create Instance</i>, we have to change the number of instances to <b>'2'</b>.</li>        
</ul>      

Step_3) After the 2 instances have been <b>created</b>, we can simply <i>change</i> the name of the instances.  
These were the steps to create the EC2 instances.

## Hands on with <b>AWS ASG (Auto Scaling Group): </b>  

Step_1) Open <i>AWS management console</i> and then <b>search</b> EC2.  

Step_2) Under "Auto Scaling", we have to click on 'Auto Scaling Groups'. Then we follow the steps:  

![Screenshot (1504)](https://github.com/Faysal-Ezaz/Project_AWS/assets/95119493/7cf8f124-0d93-4518-8471-2d7a878504a3)

        vi) Under Advanced Setting, select the following code.  
        ![Screenshot (1511)](https://github.com/Faysal-Ezaz/Project_AWS/assets/95119493/de62e588-e7a6-4c51-8090-29706f1cb135)


        #!/bin/bash  
        # Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)  
        # install httpd (Linux 2 version)  
        yum update -y  
        yum install -y httpd  
        systemctl start httpd  
        systemctl enable httpd  
        echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html   

c) Again, Under Auto-Scaling Group, "Launch Template" and select the 'DemoLaunchTemplate' and click on "Next".   
![Screenshot (1512)](https://github.com/Faysal-Ezaz/Project_AWS/assets/95119493/9d083bfc-3234-4e5a-a933-3af68f8b4b0a)

III) Under Configure Advanced Options, do the following:  
    a) Load Balancing, Attach to an "Existing Load Balancer".   
    ![Screenshot (1538)](https://github.com/Faysal-Ezaz/Project_AWS/assets/95119493/f1f972e6-61e9-486e-994e-1a905f108277)  
    b) "Choose from your Load Balancer target groups" and then click on "demo-tg-alb"  
    ![Screenshot (1539)](https://github.com/Faysal-Ezaz/Project_AWS/assets/95119493/83ecb117-280c-4150-ae8b-47426fc5f8ac)  
    c) Then click on "next".  

IV) Configure group size and scaling policies.  
    a) Then choose the no of instances at each stage required.  
    ![Screenshot (1542)](https://github.com/Faysal-Ezaz/Project_AWS/assets/95119493/ed69c1b5-5694-48cd-9a34-ac6f79778138)  
    b) No need to change any other settings.  
    c) Then click on Next.   

V) Add Notifications-Optional, Click on "Next".   

VI) Add Tags Optional. Click on "Next".   

VII) Review and click on Create "Auto Scaling Group".    


With this our Auto Scaling Group has been created.  

## Conclusion:  

Now what will happen is, if we try to <b>delete</b> any EC2 instance, The <b>Auto Scaling Group</b> will immediately start a new instance.  
This happens so that our application remains <b>highly available</b>.  
And with this we can conclude our Tutorial. 



## Steps to clean up:  

Step_1) Go to <b>Auto Scaling Group</b> and <i>"DELETE"</i> the Auto Scaling Group.  
Step_2) Go to <b>Elastic Load Balancer</b>, clean up any remaining things that needs to be cleared out.  
Step_3) Go to <b>EC2 instances</b> and <i>"DELETE"</i> the instances that we originally created.   
Step_4) Go to <b>'VOLUMES'</b> and <i>verify</i> that no volumes are running, as they can cost a lot of money if left running.   
Step_5) We can leave the Security Groups, as they donot cost us any money.  
Step_6) Search the <b>EC2 section</b> for any remaining active services and delete them as required to prevent any cost incursions. 



This concludes our Tutorial, if you liked it please donot forget to leave a follow and also if possible, be sure to share this as it may help someone!.
