## What is IaC?  
<ol>
  <li>Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax.</li>
  <li>IaC makes it easy to provision and apply infrastructure configurations, saving time. </li>
  <li>It standardizes workflows across different infrastructure providers (e.g., VMware, AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) by using a common syntax across all of them.</li>
</ol>
 
    
## Purpose of Creating this directory: 
<ol>
  <li>I shall be storing my Terraform Projects.</li>
  <li>Terraform helps creates and manages resources on cloud platforms.</li>
  <li>I shall be <i>automating</i> some of the boring stuff of AWS.</li>
</ol>  

## What is terraform : 
Terraform is an <i>Open Source</i> IAC(Infrastructure as A Code) tool used to <b>automate</b> various infrastructure tasks.  
I shall be using it primarily with AWS to automate the <i>creation</i> and <i>to destroy</i> AWS Infrastructure.  

## HCL(HashiCorp Configuration Language): 
It is a <b>[declarative language](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl)</b> used in Terraform to define infrastructure configurations.  
It provides a clean and readable syntax for expressing resources and their dependencies.
